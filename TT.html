            <h3 class="CHITCODE">Round 1: CHITCODE</h3>
            <p>In this round, there are two jars. One contains small coding questions related 
                to the C language, while the other holds the corresponding answers. 
                Participants randomly select a question chit from the first jar, solve it within a 
                specified time, and then check the answer from the second jar. This interactive 
                format adds an element of randomness and time pressure to the coding 
                challenge, making it both engaging and dynamic.
                </p>

            <h3 class="EXECUPUZZLE">Round 2: EXECU-PUZZLE</h3>
            <p>Dive into the corporate world with our Cross Words challenge. This round
                Unravels MNC-related terms to unlock the puzzle showcasing your knowledge.</p>

            <h3 class="BIDIQ">Round 3: BID-IQ</h3>
            <p>Participants bid for the chance to answer all questions from 1 to 10. The event 
                manager initiates the first bid, setting the tone for subsequent rounds. The 
                bidding process is a crucial aspect, introducing a competitive edge and strategy 
                to secure the right to answer each question. There are 10 questions in total. 
                For questions 1-7, everyone can participate. Starting from question 8, only 
                participants with the highest points are eligible to answer. For question 9, the 
                top 3 scorers get the chance, and for question 10, only the participants with 
                the top 2 scorers among them can answer. This setup ensures an inclusive 
                start and gradually narrows down to the top-performing participants as the 
                quiz progresses.
